# Leveraging CoPilot to Convert a Class Component to Functional with Hooks

In this guide, we'll use OpenAI's CoPilot to effortlessly convert the `ExampleClassComponent` from a class-based component to a functional component with hooks, all while preserving our comments.

## Starting with CoPilot

1. **Provide Context**: Before making any changes, ensure you describe the objective to CoPilot. You can do this by adding a comment:
    ```javascript
    // CoPilot, can you help me convert this class component to a functional component with hooks?
    ```

## CoPilot's Conversion Steps

1. **State Conversion**: Watch as CoPilot recognizes the component's state and suggests the use of the `useState` hook to replicate it.

2. **Lifecycle Methods**: Observe how CoPilot handles the conversion of `componentDidMount` to the `useEffect` hook.

3. **Event Handlers**: Note how CoPilot understands the purpose of each method, preserving the logic and offering a functional alternative.

4. **Render Logic**: CoPilot will consolidate the render logic in a manner consistent with functional components, making the code more readable and concise.

## Retain Comments

While CoPilot does a great job converting the logic, ensure that the context provided by comments is retained. If any comment goes missing, you can always revert or add them back.

## Verify and Test

Once the conversion is complete, review the new functional component. Ensure it captures all functionalities of the class component. Test the component in your app to confirm everything runs as expected.

## Concluding Thoughts

CoPilot provides an invaluable tool for developers looking to modernize their React codebase. Not only does it offer a seamless conversion experience, but it also ensures that developers can focus on more critical aspects of their application, enhancing productivity.
