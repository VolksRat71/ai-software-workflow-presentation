# Conversion of Class Components to Functional Components

## Objective:
Showcase how CoPilot can assist in converting a class component into a functional component, as well as generating documentation to help onboard new developers.

## Steps:

1. **Presentation of the Original Component**:
   - Begin by showing your audience the original class component.
   - Discuss its core functionalities and the reasons you chose this particular example (complexity, multiple lifecycle methods, state management, etc.).

2. **Initiate CoPilot Assistance**:
   - With your IDE open, activate CoPilot.
   - Type or say: "Can you please generate a markdown for confluence that will help new developers understand how to assess class components in order to convert them to functional components?"

3. **Document CoPilot's Suggestions**:
   - As CoPilot generates the steps, comments, or even entire markdown content, narrate what's happening to your audience.
   - Explain how CoPilot's suggestions are being tailored based on the initial query, the structure of the code, and the context of the task.

4. **Walk Through the Conversion**:
   - Using CoPilot's guidance, start the conversion process.
   - Ensure that you engage with CoPilot as needed, asking questions or seeking clarifications.
   - Highlight any challenges you face and how CoPilot assists in overcoming them.

5. **Showcase the Result**:
   - After the conversion, present the final functional component to your audience.
   - Emphasize the benefits of functional components, such as reduced code complexity, easier testing, and the advantages of hooks.

6. **Discuss the Documentation**:
   - Once the conversion is complete, go over the generated markdown for Confluence.
   - Discuss how such documentation can be invaluable for onboarding new developers, ensuring consistent code practices, and providing a reference for future conversions.

## Tips:
- Stay engaged with CoPilot during the process. It's a tool that responds dynamically based on your input and the existing code context.
- Ask CoPilot clarifying questions if any step feels unclear or if you wish to understand the reasoning behind certain recommendations.
