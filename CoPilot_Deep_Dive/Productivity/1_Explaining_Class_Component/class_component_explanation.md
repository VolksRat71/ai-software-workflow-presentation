# Explaining a Complex React Class Component

In this section, we'll be unpacking a complex React class component. We'll rely on CoPilot to guide us in understanding its structure, logic, and functionalities.

## Starting with the Component

We begin with a [`example_class_component.js`](./example_class_component.js) file. At a glance, it may seem daunting due to its lack of comments and structure.

Here are some steps to better understand it:

### 1. Understand the Component's State

Before diving into the methods, it's essential to understand the state of our component. Ask CoPilot:
- "What state variables are used in this component?"
- "What's the purpose of the `isLoading` state?"
- "Why do we need a `selectedItem` in the state?"

### 2. Identify Lifecycle Methods

React class components have lifecycle methods that run at various points.
- Ask CoPilot to explain the `componentDidMount` method.
- Inquire about the `componentDidUpdate` method and when it's triggered.

### 3. Unpack Event Handlers

There are a few methods that seem to be event handlers.
- Ask CoPilot to explain the `handleInputChange` method.
- Find out the purpose of the `handleItemSelect` method.

### 4. Render Method

The render method can be complex, especially when there's conditional rendering.
- Ask CoPilot to explain the logic inside the render method.
- Discuss the filtering logic for the items.

## Using CoPilot for Clarity

At this point, you can use CoPilot to generate comments for each section of the component. This will help in better understanding its functionality. Command CoPilot to:
- "Add comments to the `example_class_component.js` explaining each method."
- "Describe the purpose of each state variable."

## Wrap Up

With CoPilot's assistance, you can quickly unpack and understand complex codebases. This demonstration has shown how you can turn an unclear component into something digestible with the help of AI-driven insights.
